# Sample prompts

Once your MCP client is connected to the server, try prompts like:

- "Who are the top 5 customers by sales in 2014?"
- "Show sales by product category for 2014. Summarize in one paragraph."
- "Show me the most recent orders for customer 11000."

Because these are tools, the model should choose the tool calls automatically.
